Impact of label-level noise on multi-label learning: a case study on de k-Nearest Neighbor classifier

Hereâ€™s a properly formatted README.md section using Markdown syntax for GitHub:

## Running the Experiments

In this folder, you will find the source files required to run the experiments that support the article you have read. Follow these recommended steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment**

2. **Install all necessary packages**  
   The required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.  
   Use the following command:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Navigate to the source code
All source code files are located in the py_projects directory.
The file that contains the noise induction algorithms is: noise.py

4.Run the experiments
To execute the experiments, run the following shell script:

lote_auto_ruido.sh

Let me know if you want to include environment setup instructions or example outputs.
