This paper explores the effect of **label-level noise** in **multi-label classification**, using synthetic noise induction 
and k-Nearest Neighbor classifiers. We introduce controlled noise into multi-label datasets and evaluate the resulting performance variations.

<br/>


## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the environment and reproduce the experiments.

### 1. Create a virtual environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Install required packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Explore the project structure

The main source files are located in the `py_projects` directory:

- `noise.py`: Contains the noise induction algorithms used in the experiments.
- `lote_auto_ruido.sh`: Bash script to run all experiments.
- `datasets/`: Folder expected to contain the multi-label datasets (e.g., emotions, scene, etc.)


### 4. Run the experiments

To execute all the experiments, run the following script:

```bash
./lote_auto_ruido.sh
```

> üí° Make sure the script has execution permissions. You can set them with:  
> `chmod +x lote_auto_ruido.sh`
